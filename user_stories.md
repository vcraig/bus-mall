# User Stories

Marketing research team
1. As a marketing analyst, I want high integrity data collection and calculations. I want to see all the data and understand how it was collected.
2. As the CEO, I want to see it all on one page, with a high level summary.
3. As the marketing assistant, I want to understand the whole project, user interface, and data output -- because they all come to me with their questions.
4. As the CFO, I want this project to be fast, cheap, and good!

Developers
1. As a developer, I want to demonstrate economy and reusability to my cost-conscious clients.
2. As a developer, I want to implement a constructor function, so that I can reuse code and eliminate much of the duplication in my JavaScript
3. As a developer, I want an attractive, non-distracting front-end, including client's branding. So that my client can be proud and show it off to others who might hire me.
4. As a developer, I want good error handling, and any other measure to insure data collection integrity.

Focus group participants (testers)
1. As a tester, I want an easy to use interface with clear instructions and good error handling.
2. As a tester, I want this experience to be fun. Otherwise I will get bored and quit.
3. I'm a tester who likes to game your testing process. Make sure you can handle me!
4. As a visually-impaired user, I need the images to look good on my magnifier, and the text/error displays to work coherently with my screen reader.
